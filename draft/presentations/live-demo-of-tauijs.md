Create small, fast, secure, cross-platform applications with [Tauri 2.0](https://v2.tauri.app/) with the front end framework by Rust [Yew](https://yew.rs/).

This presentation will present a demo of the Taurijs library, a tool built with Rust that competes with ElectroneJS to compile a web app into a native app for computers, phones, tablets, etc., making it easier to produce an app on one codebase.
