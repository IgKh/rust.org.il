Demonstration of lilos running on an embedded development board and some example code.

This will be short since I have not used lilos at all, just read about it a lot and am enthusiastic about it. So I'll just show it - it is developed by Cliff Biffle, of Hubris fame (another embedded OS but much more complicated).

I will explain how async ties in to embedded using Cliff's own words - which you can find [here](https://cliffle.com/blog/async-inversion/)
