# Code Mavens

The [Code Mavens](https://www.meetup.com/Code-Mavens/) Meetup group exists for almost 10 years. During those years we had loads of meetings
on a lot of different topics. Recently we started to have meetings about Rust.

The main organizer of the group is [Gabor Szabo](https://szabgab.com/)
