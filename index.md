# Rust programming in Israel

On this web site you should be able to find everything about the [Rust programming language](https://www.rust-lang.org/) in Israel.

Despite the fact that our main goal is to reach the developers in Israel, most of the content will still be in English
as that's the common (written) language for most of the programming world.

## In person meetings

The [Rust TLV](https://www.meetup.com/rust-tlv/) group organizes in-person meetings for Rust programmers with presentations.
