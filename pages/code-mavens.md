The [Code Mavens](https://www.meetup.com/Code-Mavens/) Meetup group exists for almost 10 years. During those years we had loads of meetings
on a lot of different topics. Recently we started to have meetings about Rust.

## Organizers

The main organizer of the group is [Gabor Szabo](https://szabgab.com/).

## Upcoming events

See the [meetings](/meetings) page.

### 2024.04.21 - [Using AstroNvim for Rust development (Online, in Hebrew)](https://www.meetup.com/code-mavens/events/300265648/)

In this non-formal meeting [Meir Kriheli](https://www.meirkriheli.com/) a long time Open Source developer and a central figure of the Israeli Open Source community is going to share his decades of experience using AstroNvim and tmux.

He will show his own setup with a focus on how he uses it for **programming in Rust**. He will help the interesting parties to set up their own environment.

He will also show [rusmux](https://www.meirkriheli.com/en/2023/04/introducing-rusmux/), his partial replacement for the tmuxinator written in Rust.

The meeting will be in Zoom. It will start at 19:00 ILT. It will be held in Hebrew.

### 2024.05.09 - [In-person at Microsoft, Tel Aviv](https://www.meetup.com/code-mavens/events/300144781/)

Agenda:

* 18:00 Meeting amd mingling

## Past Events


### 2023.12.17 - [Don't panic! - Our journey to error handling in Rust (Online and in Hebrew)](https://www.meetup.com/code-mavens/events/297334993/)

* Speaker: [Tomer Cohen](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tomercode/) from Microsoft
* View the [blog of Tomer Cohen](https://www.tomercode.com/)
* Language: Hebrew
* Location: Online

In this talk, I will delve into the transformative journey of error handling in our first Rust project.
From an initial state where panic-induced chaos was widespread, making it challenging to pinpoint the
root causes of crashes, we navigated through the Rust ecosystem to establish a robust and stable foundation.

Utilizing some of the most common error handling crates, I will share insights into the evolution
of our error-handling practices, discussing the pitfalls encountered, and lessons learned, that led to a more resilient and maintainable codebase.

### 2023.11.12 [Rust Digger](https://www.meetup.com/code-mavens/events/297064458/)

* Speaker: [Gabor Szabo](https://szabgab.com/)
* Author of [Rust Maven](https://rust.code-maven.com/)
* Language: Hebrew
* Location: online

Overview and current status of [Rust Digger](https://rust-digger.code-maven.com/)

The goal of this project is to enhance the Rust ecosystem by analyzing the common practices of Crate developers. From basic things such as code formatting rules through practices of testing.
It also helps finding Crates that can be improved with relative little investment.
