Overview and current status of [Rust Digger](https://rust-digger.code-maven.com/)

The goal of this project is to enhance the Rust ecosystem by analyzing the common practices of Crate developers. From basic things such as code formatting rules through practices of testing.
It also helps finding Crates that can be improved with relative little investment.
