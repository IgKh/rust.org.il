description: About the Rust in Israel web site
---


The source of the site is in [this repository](https://github.com/szabgab/rust.org.il).
It uses the same [Static Site Generator](https://ssg.code-maven.com/) that is used by the [Rust Maven](https://rust.code-maven.com/).
Both are maintained by [Gabor Szabo](https://szabgab.com/).

The site is dedicated to the Rust community in Israel. On the [front page](/) you can find the various Rust-related groups in Israel.
You are invited to join any and all of them.

If you would like to make changes to this site feel free to talk to [Gabor](https://szabgab.com/contact) or send a [pull-request](https://github.com/szabgab/rust.org.il).
