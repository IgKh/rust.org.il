The source of the site is in [this repository](https://github.com/szabgab/rust.org.il).
It uses some Rust code to generate the site from various YAML and Markdown files.
The site is maintained by [Gabor Szabo](https://szabgab.com/).

The site is dedicated to the Rust community in Israel. On the [front page](/) you can find the various Rust-related groups in Israel and upcoming meetings.
You are invited to join any and all of them.
