## For the 10 years of Rust 1.0 event

Original organizers of Rust-TLV

* Yuval Adam
* Adam Gutglick


* Where is your meetup group located, for how long does it exist, in which frequency are you meeting?

The first event of the group was in September 2018 with 78 registered attendees, so I guess the group was created a bit before that.
After the initial few events there was several years break, partially due to COVID. There were a few events in 2022 and 2023.
I took over the organization in late 2024. Since then we try to have monthly in-person meetings with 2-3 presentations and 2-3 lightning talks each event.
We also have online events. Both events with presentations and events where we only chat.

* Which spoken languages do you support?

We use English for our slides and speak in Hebrew.

There is also a related group called [Code-Mavens](https://www.meetup.com/code-mavens/) where we online presentations in English. Think about it as our "international branch".

* How many people do participate in each event?

We usually have 30 people in our in-person events.

* What is the format of your group? Talks, planned workshops, book reading, unstructured?


* Are you focussing on specific niches (like embedded etc)?

We don't have any specific focus, besides **Rust**, but actually we had a number of presentations about embedded Rust.

* What are the Rust experience levels of your participants? How do you deal with wide gaps in Rust experience among your participants?
* What are your special events, like onsite meetups, celebrations and the like?
* Do you deal exclusevily with Rust or other languages/topics as well?
