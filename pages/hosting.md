title: Hosting in-person Rust
description: What we need from the companies that would like to host our in-person events?
---

We at [Rust TLV](/) like to go to old and new places with our meetings. For an in-person Rust-TLV meeting we need

## Venue requirements

* A space that can host at least 30 people.
* Has a projector and something we can use as a lectern next to the screen where we project.
* Sponsoring refreshment (e.g. pizza or sandwiches + beer and soft-drinks)
* Preferable in a place that easily accessible with public transportation.
* Our meetings are usually in Tel Aviv, but we are open to host events elsewhere as well.
* We would prefer places that would want to host us regularly every few months, but one-time hosts might be also accepted.
* An optional advantage: Video recording equipment.


## Refreshment

* Pizza or sandwitches or some more interesting snacks. Preferably Kosher with some vegan and some gluten-free options.
* Beer and soft drinks including plain water.
* Optionally fruits.
* Optionally sweets.
* Optionally snacks (Bamba, Bissli, Tapuchips, Snyder's etc.)
* Think also about the people who prefer to eat healhy.

How much food? We never know how many people will arrive, but our experience shows that it is between 25-40% of the registered people.


## Presentations

We can allocate 5-15 minutes at the beginning of the event for the host to give a short introduction of the company.
Alternatively, or even in addition, we welcome employees of the host to give a regular presentation. See [how to submit presentation offer](/cfp).

Tell us early if you'd like to do either of those so we can make sure to allocate time in the schedule.


* Contact [Gabor Szabo](https://szabgab.com/contact) if you are interested hosting one of our monthly events.
