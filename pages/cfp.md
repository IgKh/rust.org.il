* You are also invited to send an email to [Gabor](https://szabgab.com/contact) directly with your phone number so we can be in touch for any last-minute issues.
* The preferred language for the presentations is Hebrew, though if you feel it would be easier to give the talk in English that is also OK.
* Location: Most often we meet in Tel Aviv, but we also accept invitations in other locations.
* Sometimes we have more talk proposals than slots. We will discuss with you which event can be good for both you and the schedule.

## Lightning talks (up to 5 min)

In addition to the scheduled presentations we also have "lightning talks". These are short, up to 5 min long presentations.
Sometimes given without any slides. We don't schedule them up-front. If you show up at our meeting and talk to the
organizer you might get the chance to give your talk. Mostly depending on the available time.
