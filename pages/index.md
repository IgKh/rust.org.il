description: The Israeli community of people programming in Rust

On this web site you should be able to find everything about the [Rust programming language](https://www.rust-lang.org/) in Israel.

Despite the fact that our main goal is to reach the developers in Israel, most of the content will be in English
as that is the common (written) language for most of the programming world.
