I'm an electrical engineer who's passionate about software development, with experience in distributed systems and developer tooling. I created Memorix to solve the type safety and complexity challenges I encountered when working with in-memory services across multiple programming languages in microservices architectures. Iâ€™m passionate about building tools that improve developer productivity and enjoy sharing knowledge with the community, love Rust.
