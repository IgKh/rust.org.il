At a startup, moving from a small and badly developed prototype to an initial working prototype, is an important baby step that is difficult to get right. At Cynerio, we leverage Rust to allow us to deal with the complexity of handling 1-10 Gbps of traffic at the hospital's network, while parsing obscure and problematic protocols, running machine learning algorithms, and staying fault tolerant and secure. We will show how we did a gradual and iterative shift from the experimental Python code to production quality Rust and how we are using performance analytics to improve performance going forward. We will also share how our core developers, who haven't known rust, have handled the on-boarding process.

Daniel Brodie is the CTO & Co-Founder of Cynerio, a cyber security startup aimed at protecting hospital's most sensitive entities - their medical devices. Before that Daniel led the research team and a development team in Lacoon, til it was acquired by Checkpoint. Daniel has been a huge fan of hipster programming languages for many years and has fallen in love with rust 3 years ago.
