I am working on my first web application in Rust using the [Rocket web framework](https://rocket.rs/).
In this presentation I'll show what I've learned so far and how can you get started developing a web application using Rust Rocket.

We used the [rocket-starter](https://crates.io/crates/rocket-starter) crate and you saw [articles about Rocket](https://rust.code-maven.com/rocket).

these meetings and trying to energize the [Rust community in Israel](https://rust.org.il/).
