In this presentation we'll se how to read, parse, and deserialize JSON files using [serde](https://serde.rs/).

We will see a number of examples:

* Reading arbitrary JSON file.
* Verifying that we process every field in the JSON file.
* Optional fields.
* Reading data where the keys are not fixed.

If you have specific examples you would like to see, let the spaker know up-front.
