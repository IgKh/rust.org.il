In this talk, I'll walk you through my first experience with Rust, a drop-in replacement for an IO-bound and CPU-intensive production service, performing parallel in-memory aggregations on high-volume compressed text.
We'll see how the Rust implementation reduced memory footprint and improved CPU utilization. We'll also highlight some of the popular 3rd-party crates I used in the process (tokio, hyper, and rusoto), and examine a quirk or two.
