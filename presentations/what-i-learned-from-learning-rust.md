The journey of a veteran programmer from 0 to the first published Crate and beyond.

[Gabor Szabo](https://szabgab.com/) has been programming for almost 40 years and has been teaching programming for more than 20. He taught a lot of people how to use Perl and then a lot more people how to use Python. His hope is that soon he will be teaching people how to write Rust.
