This is the second part of the Web development with Rocket series. It is strongly recommended that you watch the first part and even play around a bit with the framework before attending this meeting.

The presentation is going to be about 1 hour long and then we open the floor for discussions about Rocket, web development and Rust in general.

* The meeting will be via Zoom
* Requirements: Basic familiarity with writing Rust will be enough.
