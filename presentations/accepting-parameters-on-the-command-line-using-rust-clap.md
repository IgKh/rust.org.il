When you start writing a command line application you usually start out with a very limited number of parameters. Maybe just 2 values. In that case using the `std::env::args` is enough.

However as you start adding more and more parameters that some of them depend on each other then very quickly you can get in trouble.

The clap crate is an excellent solution for such cases.

In this workshop you'll learn quite a few thing using the Clap crate.

If you have any specific use-case in mind, please comment on this event so I might be able to prepare such an example as well.

The workshop includes presentations and hands-on work.

* Requirements: Basic familiarity with writing Rust will be enough.
* Length: up to 2 hours.
