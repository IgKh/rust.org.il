Developing desktop applications with web technologies has been the norm for quite some time (at least for non-realtime applications).
Slack, VS Code, Discord, Figma, 1Password, and more apps have been built this way. While Electron was, and still remains, a great choice for doing this, there is a new contender in town.
Meet [Tauri](https://tauri.app/), designed for secure and lightweight desktop applications, without sacrificing on user experience, and while still using the mature web technologies we know and love.

In this session, I will introduce Tauri, and we will build a simple application using it together.
