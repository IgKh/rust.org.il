As Rust continues to grow in popularity, many developers seek opportunities to introduce it within their teams or organizations.
Becoming a Rust "champion" is both a rewarding and challenging mission.
In this talk, I'll share my personal experience helping a team of excellent Go engineers transition into proficient Rust developers while working on a new Rust project. I'll discuss the challenges we faced together, the lessons I learned, and practical strategies for fostering a collaborative and learning environment.
