Ownership is the breakout feature of Rust. It allows Rust to be completely memory-safe and efficient while avoiding garbage collection with a set of strict rules.
Rust enforces these rules through lifetimes. Lifetimes are effectively just names for scopes somewhere in the program.
In this session, we'll talk about how these concepts work, how to embrace it and the mental model of a Rust developer.

Isan Rivkin, a software engineer part of the protocol team at Enigma.
Enigma is an open-source project building a decentralized network in Rust for private computations.
Isan is working on the Networking, p2p, system architecture and Hardware (SGX).
