How to use NATS and Protobuf with Rust to integrate with Microservices

In this presentation, we'll explore how to use Protobuf and NATS to create a distributed system with microservices. We'll cover integrating with existing services to leverage them for faster development and reduced errors, demonstrating the benefits of using these technologies for scalable and efficient communication within a microservices architecture.
