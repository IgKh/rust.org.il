Cargo is arguably one of the best things about Rust. Not every new language comes with a mature build and package manager out of the box. Let's take a deeper look at this great tool and peek into some of its less known corners.

Anton Weiss is the Principal Consultant at Otomato Software. Internationally acclaimed speaker and trainer in the fields of software delivery and collaboration. Became interested in Rust for hobby projects about half a year ago.
