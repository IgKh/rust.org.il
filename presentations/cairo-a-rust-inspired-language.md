Additional background:

[Cairo](https://www.cairo-lang.org/) is a provable programming language developed in Starkware. It takes inspiration from Rust but follows its own path - sometimes by choice, sometimes by necessity. In this talk, we’ll compare the two languages, exploring their similarities and the trade-offs Cairo makes. Were these deviations the right call? Let’s discuss. Whether or not you plan to use Cairo, this is a chance to reflect on Rust’s influence and its impact on new languages.
