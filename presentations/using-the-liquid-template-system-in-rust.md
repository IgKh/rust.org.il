When you need to create many well-designed reports with different data, or when you create web pages where the content changes from one-page to another or from one visitor to another, it is common to use a template system.

The template systems are not very complex, but many people, when they start writing a project feel that they only have very simple need and thus the use of a "real" template system is not warranted.

So they create their own simple template system.

Then as the project growth their needs get more and more complex and they end up with a full-fledged template system.

It is so common that creating your own template system seems like a rite of passage in many circles.

In this workshop you'll learn about one of the successful template systems called Liquid. It was originally written at Shopify in Ruby, but it has an implementation in Rust as well.

We will learn how to use and extend the Rust version.

The workshop includes a presentation which is about 1 hour long and then you can practice what we learned while I answer questions and help if there is any need.

* Requirements: Basic familiarity with writing Rust will be enough.
* Length: up to 3 hours.
