This the extended (~ 1 hour) version of the presentation Yoray gave at our in-person meeting last month.

Neural Networks are one of the most popular models in Machine Learning, and are the basis for a lot of popular AI applications, such as Computer Vision (CV), Natural Language Processing (NLP), and more. In this presentation, I show the math behind Neural Nets, how to train them, and how I implemented one in Rust from scratch to recognize digits in images.
The presentation is based on a post Yoray wrote: [Digit Recognition with Rust and WASM](https://vaktibabat.github.io/posts/Rust_WASM_Digit_Recognition_1/).
About Yoray: I am a third-year CS student at the Open University. Other than that, I am very interested in cybersecurity, reverse engineering, Malware Analysis, AI, and Rust (for about 6 months). I run a blog [here](https://vaktibabat.github.io/).

Organizer: [Gabor Szabo](https://szabgab.com/)
Location: This is a virtual event. We'll publish the Zoom link a few hours before the event.
