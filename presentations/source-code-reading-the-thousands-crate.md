The [thousands](https://crates.io/crates/thousands) crate is a small crate that will help "commafy" a number. That is, put commas between triplets of digits to make the number more readable. So it will convert 1234567 to 1,234,567.

During this even we'll go over the implementation of this crate.

* The event will be via Zoom (link will be announced close to the event)
