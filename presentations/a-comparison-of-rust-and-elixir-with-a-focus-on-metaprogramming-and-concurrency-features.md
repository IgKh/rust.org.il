Rust and Elixir have both gained significant traction in the software engineering world, largely due to their unique approaches to safety, performance, and scalability.

While Rust leverages its powerful ownership model for memory safety and high-performance concurrency, Elixir harnesses the Erlang VM to easily distribute tasks across processes.

In this talk, I'll compare their core features—especially metaprogramming and concurrency—to highlight how each language delivers robust and maintainable applications.
