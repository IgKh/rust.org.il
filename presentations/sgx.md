Intel SGX protects selected code and data from disclosure or modification. Developers can partition their application into processor-hardened enclaves or protected areas of execution in memory that increase security even on compromised platforms. The talk will focus on understanding SGX and how it can be used with the Rust-SDK that was released not so long ago.

Isan Rivkin, a software engineer part of the protocol team at Enigma.
Enigma is an open-source project building a decentralized network in Rust for private computations.
