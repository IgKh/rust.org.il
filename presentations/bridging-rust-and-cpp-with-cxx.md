Introduction to using the [cxx](https://cxx.rs/) crate for creating direct, "safe", bi-directional FFI bindings between Rust and C++.

Draft Agenda:

* Exploring the problem space, and `cxx`'s specific approach to it.
* Looking at a small, yet real-world example.
* Architectural concerns ("Who is driving the linker?")
* Time permitting: the bigger ecosystem - [autocxx](https://github.com/google/autocxx), [cxx-qt](https://github.com/KDAB/cxx-qt), [Corrosion](https://corrosion-rs.github.io/corrosion/).
