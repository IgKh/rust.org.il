* Rust Under The Hood by [Isan Rivkin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/isan-rivkin/):

Ownership is the breakout feature of Rust. It allows Rust to be completely memory-safe and efficient while avoiding garbage collection with a set of strict rules.
Rust enforces these rules through lifetimes. Lifetimes are effectively just names for scopes somewhere in the program.
In this session, we'll talk about how these concepts work, how to embrace it and the mental model of a Rust developer.

Isan Rivkin, a software engineer part of the protocol team at Enigma.
Enigma is an open-source project building a decentralized network in Rust for private computations.
Isan is working on the Networking, p2p, system architecture and Hardware (SGX).

* Re-Implementing Electrum Server by [Roman Zeyde](https://www.linkedin.com/in/roman-zeyde/) - [slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1gZbykgg3oPurBWHB-tJD2jnRzJ61XCiZjaxHqJ7z4ag/edit#slide=id.p)

(Up to date version of the slides can be found [here](https://github.com/romanz/electrs))

In this talk, we will discuss the architecture of the Electrum Bitcoin wallet, current blockchain indexing solutions and their limitations, and present an efficient re-implementation of the [Electrum](bit.ly/electrs) indexing and query server in Rust.

[Roman Zeyde](https://romanzey.de/) has over 14 years of software development experience, working on distributed storage systems, embedded devices, linux kernel development, digital signal processing and scientific computing.
Currently, Roman is working on open-source projects related to the latest breakthroughs in distributed systems and applied cryptography.
