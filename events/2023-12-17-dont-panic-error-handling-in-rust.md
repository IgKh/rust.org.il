In this talk, I will delve into the transformative journey of error handling in our first Rust project.
From an initial state where panic-induced chaos was widespread, making it challenging to pinpoint the
root causes of crashes, we navigated through the Rust ecosystem to establish a robust and stable foundation.

Utilizing some of the most common error handling crates, I will share insights into the evolution
of our error-handling practices, discussing the pitfalls encountered, and lessons learned, that led to a more resilient and maintainable codebase.
