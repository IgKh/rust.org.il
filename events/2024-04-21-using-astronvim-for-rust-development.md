In this non-formal meeting [Meir Kriheli](https://www.meirkriheli.com/) a long time Open Source developer and a central figure of the Israeli Open Source community is going to share his decades of experience using AstroNvim and tmux.

He will show his own setup with a focus on how he uses it for **programming in Rust**. He will help the interesting parties to set up their own environment.

He will also show [rusmux](https://www.meirkriheli.com/en/2023/04/introducing-rusmux/), his partial replacement for the tmuxinator written in Rust.

The meeting will be in Zoom. It will start at 19:00 ILT. It will be held in Hebrew.
