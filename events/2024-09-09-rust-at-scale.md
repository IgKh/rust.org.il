Host: [Coralogix](https://coralogix.com/)

* Time: 17:30-20:00

At the event, you'll learn about:

* Memory Allocators: Discover the variety of memory allocators available in Rust beyond the default; understand why tuning them is crucial even in a language without garbage collection.
* DRY Principles: Find out how using Cargo Workspaces in Rust can simplify dependency management and reduce production issues.
* Efficient Querying: See how Coralogix efficiently queries metrics in sub-seconds on object storage by decoupling storage from compute.

#### Agenda:

* 17:30-18:00 Gathering and yummy food

Please let us know in advance if you have any special dietary requirements (e.g. Vegan, Kosher, etc.). We will do our best to accommodate.

* 18:00-18:15 The Coralogix Journey by [Ariel Assaraf](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ariel-assaraf-ab621896/), CEO

Learn about the incredible journey of Coralogix in the observability space from the CEO himself.

* 18:15-18:35 Simplifying Dependency Management with Workspaces by [Roy Prager](https://www.linkedin.com/in/roy-prager-40656a119/)

Join us as we share our experience of simplifying dependency management by adopting Cargo Workspaces in Rust. See how this approach helped us to reduce overhead and prevent production issues across our services.

* 18:35-19:10 Exploring Memory Allocators by Ronen Cohen

Discover the variety of memory allocators available in Rust beyond the default, and learn why tuning them is crucial even in a language without garbage collection.

* 19:25-20:00 Querying Metrics in Sub-Seconds on Object Storage by [Oron Sharabi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/oron-sharabi-27615b26/)

When designing our metrics product at Coralogix, we decided to decouple storage from compute. Learn about how this allows our customers to store their metrics data cost-effectively in their own S3 buckets.
