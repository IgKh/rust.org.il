Host: [Coralogix](https://coralogix.com/)

* Time: 17:30-20:00

At the event, you'll learn about:

* Memory Allocators: Discover the variety of memory allocators available in Rust beyond the default; understand why tuning them is crucial even in a language without garbage collection.
* DRY Principles: Find out how using Cargo Workspaces in Rust can simplify dependency management and reduce production issues.
* Efficient Querying: See how Coralogix efficiently queries metrics in sub-seconds on object storage by decoupling storage from compute.

#### Agenda:

* 17:30-18:00 Gathering and yummy food

Please let us know in advance if you have any special dietary requirements (e.g. Vegan, Kosher, etc.). We will do our best to accommodate.
