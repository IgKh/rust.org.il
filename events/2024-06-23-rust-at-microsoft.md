* [Yoray Herzberg](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yoray-herzberg-b8155621b/): Implementing a Neural Network in Rust (20 min)

Neural Networks are one of the most popular models in Machine Learning, and are the basis for a lot of popular AI applications, such as Computer Vision (CV), Natural Language Processing (NLP), and more. In this presentation, I show the math behind Neural Nets, how to train them, and how I implemented one in Rust from scratch to recognize digits in images.

The presentation is based on a post Yoray wrote: [Digit Recognition with Rust and WASM](https://vaktibabat.github.io/posts/Rust_WASM_Digit_Recognition_1/).

* [Neural Networks in Rust GitHub repository](https://github.com/vaktibabat/rust-neural-nets)

About Yoray: I am a third-year CS student at the Open University. Other than that, I am very interested in cybersecurity, reverse engineering, Malware Analysis, AI, and Rust (for about 6 months). I run a blog [here](https://vaktibabat.github.io/).

* [Ron Zigelman](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ron-zigelman/): Microservices, Message Brokers, and Protobuf with Rust (20 min)

How to use NATS and Protobuf with Rust to integrate with Microservices

In this presentation, we'll explore how to use Protobuf and NATS to create a distributed system with microservices. We'll cover integrating with existing services to leverage them for faster development and reduced errors, demonstrating the benefits of using these technologies for scalable and efficient communication within a microservices architecture.

About Ron: I am a Software Engineer, Architect, and Independent Software Consultant. I have extensive experience developing in .NET and, in recent years, have focused on building distributed systems using Rust. I am particularly interested in P2P and decentralized networks.

* If time permits: [Gabor Szabo](https://szabgab.com/): Contribution to an Open Source Rust crate, and update on the [Rust Digger](https://rust-digger.code-maven.com/) project.
