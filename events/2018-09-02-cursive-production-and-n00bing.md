September's meetup will feature a great variety of experiences:

* N00bing Through Rust by [Yuval Adam](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yuvaladam/):

The Rust language no doubt has a steep learning curve.
In this talk I will share my experience of getting started with Rust in addition to some ideas that can be applied to making things easier for Rust beginners.

Yuval Adam is a full stack developer, freelance consultant and a Rustacean in the making

* Rusty Life by [Noam Tenne](https://www.linkedin.com/in/noam-tenne/):

Rust may be a server side language, but it doesn't have to cower in the shadows. In this session we'll talk about how we can prettify our Rust programs using a GUI built with Cursive.

Noam is a hacker-hearted symmathecist. He's been working on both cloud based and on-premise platforms, gaining much experience in building scalable, mission critical web applications and microservices. He's now wreaking havoc at Healthy.io

* Rust In Production by [Daniel Brodie](https://www.linkedin.com/in/danielbrodie/) CTO & Co-Founder at [Cynerio](https://www.cynerio.com/):

At a startup, moving from a small and badly developed prototype to an initial working prototype, is an important baby step that is difficult to get right. At Cynerio, we leverage Rust to allow us to deal with the complexity of handling 1-10 Gbps of traffic at the hospital's network, while parsing obscure and problematic protocols, running machine learning algorithms, and staying fault tolerant and secure. We will show how we did a gradual and iterative shift from the experimental Python code to production quality Rust and how we are using performance analytics to improve performance going forward. We will also share how our core developers, who haven't known rust, have handled the on-boarding process.

Daniel Brodie is the CTO & Co-Founder of Cynerio, a cyber security startup aimed at protecting hospital's most sensitive entities - their medical devices. Before that Daniel led the research team and a development team in Lacoon, til it was acquired by Checkpoint. Daniel has been a huge fan of hipster programming languages for many years and has fallen in love with rust 3 years ago.
