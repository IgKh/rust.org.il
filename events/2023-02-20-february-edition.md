RustTLV is back to celebrate a new year of events, this time hosted by [BioCatch](https://www.biocatch.com/) with Redis! We'll have great speakers from both companies, on a varied list of topics.
We're trying a somewhat different format this time, with one conventional talk, and a bunch of lightning talks, please let us know what do you think!

#### Lightning Talks!
