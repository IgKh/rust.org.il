After a super successful post-COVID meetup, Rust TLV is back at it with another event strategically scheduled between the end of summer vacation and right before holiday season kicks in.

[Healthy.io](https://healthy.io/) will (once again) be hosting us in their shiny new offices on the 31st floor right in the middle of Tel Aviv, and Final will be graciously taking care of all the logistics, including snacks and drinks to make it a great event.
