In the most recent in-person meeting I talked about the [Rocket web framework](https://rocket.rs/). I am going to give an updated and extended version of the presentation, this time in Zoom.

This will give the opportunity to everyone who could not attend the in-person meeting to hear the presentation. It will be also a good opportunity to ask questions.

* When 18:00
* Speaker and organizer: [Gabor Szabo](https://szabgab.com/)
* Length: 1 hour, maybe a bit longer.
